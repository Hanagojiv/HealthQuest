A Java swing program called HealthQuest eco-system integrates data from all facets of the healthcare value chain, from chemical compounds through patient care and recovery, to do analytics on the data. The HealthQuest eco-system keeps statistical records of a chemical compound that is active and effective at attacking a certain gene in a disease and offers a chemical compound to test its efficacy against other diseases that have the same gene. We think that implementing a universally accepted global data standard and modernizing the healthcare value system would help the HealthQuest ecosystem to further enhance patient care.


### Approach
To assist HealthQuest in integrating data from various healthcare system sources.to give global biotechnology companies like HealthQuest a shared platform on which to concentrate on the discovery and marketing of novel pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease in patients receiving healthcare anywhere in the world.

The drug industry keeps track of the gene and the chemical molecule that it is targeting. In order to prevent any delays in the production of a new drug, a drug maker can do this in the future when a new disease is caused by the combination of existing genes.

### Future Scope
The application concentrates on doing analysis on data that HealthQuest owns in all phases of the healthcare value chain, from chemical compounds to patient treatment and recovery.


PROCUREMENT- offering a method for order tracking information sharing and collaboration send the details related to the illness from the hospital to the lab and lab to the BioTechnology from there to Chemical Industry.

RELATED TO THE DISEASE FROM THE HOSPITAL TO THE LAB AND LAB TO THE DRUG COMPANY FROM THERE TO CHEMICAL ENTERPRISE.

PATIENT PARTICIPATION IN CLINICAL TRIAL.
